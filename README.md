> Ready-to-use email templates for every stage of trade show outreach — pre-show invitations, onsite follow-ups, and post-show conversion sequences.

**70% of trade show leads are never followed up.** These templates help B2B sales and marketing teams systematically engage prospects before, during, and after every event.

## How to Use

1. Browse the templates below and pick the one that fits your scenario
2. Copy the email body
3. Replace all `[variables]` with your actual information
4. Customize the tone to match your brand voice
5. Send and track responses

## Templates

### Pre-Show (Before the Event)

| Template | Scenario |
|:---|:---|
| [Initial Introduction](templates/pre-show/01-initial-introduction.md) | First contact with an exhibitor you want to meet |
| [Meeting Request](templates/pre-show/02-meeting-request.md) | Requesting a 1:1 meeting at the show |
| [Mutual Connection](templates/pre-show/03-mutual-connection.md) | Warm intro through a shared contact |
| [Content Share](templates/pre-show/04-content-share.md) | Sharing valuable content to build trust before asking for a meeting |
| [Pre-Show Reminder](templates/pre-show/05-reminder.md) | Reminder 1 week before the event |

### Onsite (During the Event)

| Template | Scenario |
|:---|:---|
| [Nice to Meet You](templates/onsite/01-nice-to-meet.md) | Same-day follow-up after meeting someone |
| [Booth Visit Follow-Up](templates/onsite/02-booth-visit-followup.md) | Someone visited your booth |
| [Missed Connection](templates/onsite/03-missed-connection.md) | You had a meeting planned but didn't connect |

### Post-Show (After the Event)

| Template | Scenario |
|:---|:---|
| [Thank You](templates/post-show/01-thank-you.md) | Sent within 24-48 hours after the event |
| [Recap and Next Steps](templates/post-show/02-recap-and-next-steps.md) | Summarize what you discussed and propose next steps |
| [Resource Share](templates/post-show/03-resource-share.md) | Send promised materials (case study, demo, report) |
| [No Response Follow-Up](templates/post-show/04-no-response-followup.md) | Second touch when the first email gets no reply |
| [Long-Term Nurture](templates/post-show/05-long-term-nurture.md) | Stay in touch when timing isn't right yet |
| [Feedback Request](templates/post-show/06-feedback-request.md) | Ask for feedback from partners or organizers |

### LinkedIn Messages

| Template | Scenario |
|:---|:---|
| [Connection Request](templates/linkedin/01-connection-request.md) | Pre-show and post-show connection requests |
| [InMail Outreach](templates/linkedin/02-inmail-outreach.md) | Formal InMail for cold outreach |

## Best Practices

- **Timing matters.** Send pre-show emails 4-6 weeks out. Send post-show follow-ups within 48 hours.
- **Personalize everything.** Templates are starting points — the more specific you are about the person and their business, the higher your response rate.
- **Keep it short.** Aim for 80-120 words in the email body. Busy people skim.
- **One CTA per email.** Don't ask for a meeting, a demo, and feedback in the same email.
- **A/B test subject lines.** Try 2-3 variations and track which gets more opens.
- **Follow up, but don't spam.** 2-3 follow-ups max. Space them 3-5 business days apart.
- **Track everything.** Use your CRM or email tool to measure open rates, reply rates, and meetings booked.
