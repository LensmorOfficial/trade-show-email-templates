# LinkedIn Connection Request

> **When to use:** Connecting with someone before or after meeting them at a trade show.
> **Best timing:** Pre-show (2-3 weeks before) or post-show (within 48 hours)
> **Expected acceptance rate:** 40-60%

## Connection Note Options

LinkedIn connection notes are limited to 300 characters. Here are options for different scenarios.

### Pre-Show

**Version A — Direct**

> Hi [First Name], I see [Company Name] is exhibiting at [Show Name]. I'll be there too — would love to connect and see if there's an opportunity to chat at the event. Looking forward to it!

**Version B — Softer**

> Hi [First Name], preparing for [Show Name] and came across your profile. Impressive work in [their area]. Would be great to connect ahead of the event.

### Post-Show

**Version A — You met in person**

> Hi [First Name], great meeting you at [Show Name]! Really enjoyed our conversation about [topic]. Let's stay connected.

**Version B — You didn't meet but attended the same show**

> Hi [First Name], we were both at [Show Name] this week. I work in [your area] and think there could be some good synergies. Would love to connect.
