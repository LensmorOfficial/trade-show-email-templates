## InMail Body

### Version A — Exhibitor to exhibitor

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is exhibiting at [Show Name] in [Month] — so are we.

I lead [your area] at [Your Company], where we help [Industry] companies [one-sentence value prop]. Looking at what [Company Name] does in [their space], I think there's a conversation worth having.

Would you be open to a 10-minute meeting at the event? Happy to come to your booth.

Best,
[Your Name]

Hi [First Name],

I'll be attending [Show Name] in [Month] and your booth is already on my must-visit list. [Company Name]'s work in [their area] is really interesting.

I'm exploring solutions in [your need area] and would love to learn more about your approach. Would you have a few minutes to chat at the event?

Looking forward to it.

## Tips

- InMails cost credits — make every one count by being specific and concise
- Mentioning the shared event dramatically increases response rates vs. generic cold InMails
- Keep InMails under 100 words — LinkedIn's own data shows shorter messages get more replies
- If they don't respond to InMail, don't send another — try email instead
