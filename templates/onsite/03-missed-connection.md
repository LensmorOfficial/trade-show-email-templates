## Email Body

Hi [First Name],

I'm sorry we didn't get to connect at [Show Name] today — these events can be hectic. I was really looking forward to our conversation about [topic].

Would you be available tomorrow at the show? I'm flexible on timing and can meet at your booth, ours ([Booth Number]), or anywhere in between.

If the rest of the event is fully booked, I'd love to schedule a call for next week instead. Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
