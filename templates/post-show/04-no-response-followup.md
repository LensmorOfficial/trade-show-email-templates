## Email Body

### Version A — Brief bump

Hi [First Name],

Just wanted to bump this in case it got buried in post-show catch-up. I know the inbox after a trade show is brutal.

Still happy to [specific CTA from original email]. If now isn't the right time, no worries — just let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Version B — Add new value

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from last week after [Show Name]. I realize you're probably swamped with post-event follow-ups.

Since we last spoke, I came across [new relevant thing — article, data point, or insight] that connects to what we discussed about [topic]. Thought you might find it useful: [URL]

Still happy to continue our conversation when timing works for you. Would [Date] work for a quick call?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Tips

- Version A is faster to send; Version B adds new value and tends to get better responses
- Reply to your original email thread so they see the context
- After 2 follow-ups with no response, move to long-term nurture (05-long-term-nurture.md) or stop
- Never guilt-trip — "I've emailed you 3 times" is a relationship killer
