### Version A — Direct

Hi [First Name],

I'll be at [Show Name] on [Dates] and would love to schedule a short meeting with you.

We help [Industry] companies [key benefit — one sentence], and based on what [Company Name] is doing in [specific area], I think it's worth a conversation.

Would [Day 1] or [Day 2] work for a 15-minute sit-down? Happy to come to your booth or meet at the cafe area.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Version B — Softer

Hi [First Name],

I see [Company Name] will be at [Show Name] — great to know we'll be at the same event.

I've been following your work in [specific area] and think there's potential to [collaborate / exchange ideas / explore synergies]. Would you have 15 minutes during the show to connect?

No pressure either way — I know these events get hectic. Just thought it was worth reaching out.

Best,
[Your Name]
