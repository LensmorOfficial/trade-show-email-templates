# Pre-Show Reminder

> **When to use:** You've already emailed once (introduction or meeting request) and want to follow up before the show.
> **Best timing:** 5-7 days before the event
> **Expected response rate:** 10-15%

## Subject Line Options

1. `[Show Name] is next week — still open to connect?`
2. `Quick follow-up before [Show Name]`
3. `See you at [Show Name]?`

## Email Body

### Version A — Follow-up on a previous email

Hi [First Name],

Just a quick note — [Show Name] is next week and I wanted to follow up on my earlier email.

I'll be at the event [Days] and would still love to connect if your schedule allows. Even 10 minutes over coffee would be great.

If the timing doesn't work this time, no worries at all. Hope you have a great show.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Version B — Fresh reminder (no prior email)

Hi [First Name],

[Show Name] is right around the corner. I'll be there on [Days] and wanted to see if you'd be open to a quick hello.

We're working on [brief context — one sentence], and I think there's an interesting conversation to be had with someone in your role.

Booth [Booth Number] or wherever works for you — just let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Tips

- Keep it even shorter than the first email — they know who you are by now

- Include your booth number so they can find you easily
- This is your last pre-show touch — if they don't respond, try to connect onsite
